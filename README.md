## Overview

Your customers have questions. Can your website answer them?

Boost conversion, reduce support costs, and gain new customer intelligence by adding Yext Answers site search to your WordPress-powered website. The Yext Answers Site Search plugin allows you to seamlessly integrate your Yext Answers search bar and search results page to your existing WordPress pages. If you don’t currently work with Yext but would like to add the world’s best site search to your WordPress site, get started today at [https://www.yext.com/try/wordpress/](https://www.yext.com/try/wordpress/).

With the Yext AI Search plugin, you can now:

- Easily index WordPress data to Yext with pre-built connectors, and use that data to power your Answers experience
- Schedule automatic data syncs to keep your search results up to date
- Live edit the styling of your search bar, no coding background required!
- Drag and drop your Answers experience onto any page of your WordPress site with Gutenberg blocks
- Replace all instances of native WordPress search with the click of a button

To use this plugin you must have a Yext account. The Yext Answers Site Search plugin is search-as-a-service; upon download, you will be asked to provide your Answers API key and a few other pieces of information in order for the plugin to work. We’ll be calling the Answers Javascript SDK (and its CSS and templates) in order to render the search bar and Javascript from our Pages platform to load the search results page.
Using Yext Answers is subject to the agreement entered into between you and Yext. View Yext’s privacy policy here: [https://www.yext.com/privacy-policy](https://www.yext.com/privacy-policy).
